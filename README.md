AI-Accident is a Django-based application designed to streamline the insurance and legal process of accident reconstruction. By combining user-drawn visual data with contextual questioning, the system utilizes an AI model to calculate and assign liability percentages to the parties involved.

[!IMPORTANT] Repository Note: Due to the large file size of the full Django environment and static assets, this repository contains a curated selection of the core .py files.
These files represent the logic, AI integration, and backend architecture of the project.
